# LifeTable
`LifeTable.jl` contains the function `LifeTable`, which can be used to calculate life tables in accordance with the methods used by [Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org/) (in particular, see the [Methods Protocol](http://www.mortality.org/Public/Docs/MethodsProtocol.pdf) 38--39). The function is called like `LifeTable(inframe, sex, intype)`, where `inframe` is a [DataFrame](https://github.com/JuliaStats/DataFrames.jl), `sex` may be given as `1` or `2` for males or females (the calculation of average numbers lived for those dying as infants differs between the sexes), and `intype` can be `"count"` (the default) or `"rate"`. The first column in `inframe` is assumed to be an age vector. If `intype="count"`, the second column is assumed to be a vector of age-specific population at risk, and the third column is assumed to be a vector of age-specific death counts. If `inframe="rate"`, the second column is assumed to contain age-specific death rates. The function returns a new dataframe with the life table.
